## Proposal

Create a GitHub action that is triggered on commits to categories which traverse through the submissions from inside the each category and generate a markdown file which summarizes all of the submitted tasks / proposals.

The requirements for the actions is:

-   Automatic trigger for new submissions
-   Include the authors and title of the task
-   Link to the sub-directory
-   Classify if completed or not
