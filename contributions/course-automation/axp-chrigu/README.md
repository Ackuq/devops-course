## Proposal

Create a GitHub action that is triggered when new tasks / proposals are committed to the repository, this will then generate a dashboard of all the contributions made overall, including those submitted in the previous years.

The requirements for the actions is:

-   Automatic trigger for new submissions
-   Include the authors and title of the task
-   Link to the task
-   Classify if completed or not
-   Group by year and category
-   Display the number of submissions per category / year
