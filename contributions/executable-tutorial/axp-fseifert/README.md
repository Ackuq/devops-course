## Proposal

Heroku is a webservice where users can run simple web applications for free for a limited number of hours per month. The obvious approach is to run serverless applications which are billed per second. However, Heroku does not offer the option to deploy serverless applications of-the-shelf.

We found a way on how to use Heroku's One-off Dynos, which are not addressable via HTTP requests, to process Functions-as-a-Service via providing arguments via environment variables. This approach is mentioned on the web only a single time. We want to create a tutorial on how to use Heroku to deploy a serverless application. As this tutorial is not executable simply via the browser and requires interactions with Heroku and GitHub, we do not want to use a platform for online tutorials and suggest to create a GitHub repo which contains source code examples and detailed descriptions on how to achieve the serverless deployment.
